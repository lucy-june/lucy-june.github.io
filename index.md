# Summary

As a full stack software engineer, I believe our ultimate goal is to make a perfect product. Sometimes, it's like a dream that's not something we can achieve in the short term, but we keep pursuing it in our life. 

I love technology. I love world. No matter where am I, in my hometown of China or relocated in the USï¼ŒI have a dream to use technologies to make the world a little better. No matter how my life evolve, this mission remains constant.
